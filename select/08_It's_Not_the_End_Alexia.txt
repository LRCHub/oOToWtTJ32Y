Now I know, how you feel
Going down without the chance to deal
No more friends, to take your hand
Without the reason to beleive
Do they know, the way it feels
Living in this world that's made of steel
With no plans, as a broken man
Losing your mind, it's hard to survive
You don't have to kick a fight because they'd never understand
All you've got to do beleive in yourself
'Cause this is not the end
Where's he gone? The man I've known
The one who used to teach me to be strong
Did you cry? Don't try to hide
I read inside your mind baby
Don't lose yourself, there's still a chance
We can try to take the right form wrong
Let me stay, show me your way
Your sunny side until the end of the line
You can say to me you're sorry
But you know that is no good
This is not a story, baby this is you
You've lost your mind, you've lost your friends
You've lost your everything again
Without your love you can't pretend
But if you keep this burning flame I'll understand
I'll understand baby
This is not the end
(You've lost your mind)
(You've lost your friends) no, no, no, no
(You've lost your soul)
(Don't be afraid, I'll be there)
(You've lost your mind) Now that I know
(You've lost your friends) The way you feel
(You've lost your soul) I think it's time
(Don't be afraid, I'll be there) to say I'm sorry
(You've lost your mind) Don't try to hide
(You've lost your friends) The pain inside you
(You've lost your soul) Your eyes are talking
(Don't be afraid, I'll be there) To me baby
(You've lost your mind) I don't beleive
(You've lost your friends) It's over darling
(You've lost your soul) It's not the end
(Don't be afraid, I'll be there) just talk again
You don't have to kick a fight because they'd never understand
All you've got to beleive in yourself
'Cause this is not the end
You've lost your mind, you've lost your friends (no)
You've lost your everything again
(Hey hey yeah) You've lost your mind, you've lost your friends
You've lost your everything again
(Oh oh) Without your love (your everything) you can't pretend
But if you keep this (but if you keep this burning flame) burning
Flame I'll understand
I'll understand baby
This is not the end
(You've lost your mind)
(You've lost your friends)
(You've lost your soul) I wanna see you mind baby
(Don't be afraid, I'll be there)
(You've lost your mind) Don't wanna see you cry
(You've lost your friends)
(You've lost your soul) Don't say it's over
(Don't be afraid, I'll be there) Don't say it's all over
(You've lost your mind) It's not the end
(You've lost your friends) No no
(You've lost your soul) I need you to be strong baby
(Don't be afraid, I'll be there)
(You've lost your mind) I don't wanna see you cry
(You've lost your friends)
(You've lost your soul)
(Don't be afraid, I'll be there) This is not my man
(You've lost your mind) Why are you doing this Ask yourself
(You've lost your friends)
(You've lost your soul) Why aren't you keeping going babe
(Don't be afraid, I'll be there)
(You've lost your mind) I need you to be strong baby
(You've lost your friends)
(You've lost your soul) This is not the end
(Don't be afraid, I'll be there) This is not the end
