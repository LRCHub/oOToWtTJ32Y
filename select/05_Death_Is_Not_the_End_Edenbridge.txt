Going round in circles
Another dreary day
Any crumb of hope could save
An animal at bay

The prime of life has gone by
Caught in no man's land
No rosy dawn can light my day
Neither family, nor friend

And in a lucid moment
It was all so very clear
The time is right
To overcome the fear

Taking a stroll down on memory lane
One moment, one lifetime, we'll meet again
Cause I still believe, death is not the end
All mortal clay, but my soul transcends

The gloomy thoughts have come back
I couldn't find my way
What could have been, could I have seen
Why led it astray?

One day I was hoping
To set the world on fire
And looking back now in the end
Left is the desire

But please enshrine the memory
And build a place for me
I'll be there
Always lean on me

Taking a stroll down on memory lane
One moment, one lifetime, we'll meet again
Cause I still believe, death is not the end
All mortal clay, but my soul transcends

For the life of me, I've gone my merry way
Not lost beyond recall
Time will pass and ease your pain
And all the good things will remain
Don't cry, I have come to rest
I'm safe back home

Taking a stroll down on memory lane
One moment, one lifetime, we'll meet again
Cause I still believe, death is not the end
All mortal clay, but my soul transcends

Taking a stroll down on memory lane
One moment, one lifetime, we'll meet again
Cause I still believe, death is not the end
All mortal clay, but my soul transcends
