Many wild goose chases
Uh girl just forget that man
You've a lot of aces up your sleeve
You must try to play them
Believe me girl you're better better without him
Now it's no time to scream
Uh girl now you're needing just a good friend
To give you a hand

Uh girl it's not the end of the world
Uh girl it's not the end of the world

I know that he hurt you
Uh girl don't forget his lies
He used to desert you, all alone
On your restless nights
It's wrong to remember only the good times
Don't you wonder why
Oh babe there's a friend who's calling your name
Don't let him call in vain

Uh girl it's not the end of the world
Uh girl it's not the end of the world
